Game Plan
    Manufacture products
    Start with a single egg-laying hen and a roadside stand
    Sell eggs, reinvest money into more chickens, etc.
    
    Main theme is to make money and reinvest (basic incremental game outline)
    Twist is the large number of constraints which restrict progress
        Examples:
        - fruit trees (or etc.) produce a maximum produce but ...
        - need a certain number of employees to harvest all that fruit
        - need different employees to sell it
        - at some point, you need to hire managers (and then managers of managers, and ...)
        - you could hire HR people to hire people for you, but ...
        - you can't hire more people than the area around your office contains ...
        - you can establish more offices, but this is more complicated (more managers...)
        - you can't hire more people than actually exist, so ...
        
        colonize space! (and so on)

MWP - minimum working product
What's the first step?
    basic clicker - click a button, get an apple, click another button, trade the apple for money
    keep track of game state with various counters of resources
        use BigInteger everywhere for safety (it's not overflowing NOW, but it will!)
    get a webpage with those two buttons on it
    
how to accomplish this?
